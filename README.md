# rstats-ed

Inspired by the [Using Julia in the classroom](https://julialang.org/teaching/) page and suggestion by [@Peter_Griffin](https://community.rstudio.com/u/peter_griffin)'s [post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/big-data-with-microsoft-open-r/13183/18?u=mine) on RStudio Community as well as the [Learn the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/) page.

The goal is to create a repository where one can discover courses and learning materials for learning and teaching R.

This is a user curated list and is bound to be non-comprehensive at all times. If you have suggestions for courses to add, please submit a pull request or add an issue.

## In person courses

### University courses teaching R

These are semester/quarter long courses taught fully, or for the most part, in an in person setting.

#### 2020

- [Data Science in R: A Robust Toolkit For Psychological Research](https://djnavarro.link/robust-tools/), by [Danielle Navarro](https://github.com/djnavarro). An introductory class offered at the University of New South Wales, aimed at students with little to no background in statistics or computing. Practical scientific topics covered include data visualisation, data wrangling, document preparation with R markdown, sharing code with GitHub and project management. The programming side to the class covers data structures in R, flow control and programming with functions. For fun, there are also sections on creating generative art in R.

- [Psych 252: Statistical Methods](https://psych252.github.io/), by [Tobias Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/). Stanford University. This course offers an introduction to advanced topics in statistics with the focus of understanding data in the behavioral and social sciences. It is a practical course in which learning statistical concepts and building models in R go hand in hand. The course is organized into three parts: In the first part, we will learn how to visualize, wrangle, and simulate data in R. In the second part, we will cover topics in frequentist statistics (such as multiple regression, logistic regression, and mixed effects models) using the general linear model as an organizing framework. We will learn how to compare models using simulation methods such as bootstrapping and cross-validation. In the third part, we will focus on Bayesian data analysis as an alternative framework for answering statistical questions.
